/*The food chain shows how each living thing gets its food. Some animals eat plants and
some eat other animals to survive. Your project is to create first inheritance hierarchy
models of all the food chains that you can think of starting with ‘forest’ as the base class.
Then create a menu driven program which displays the food chains of the various animals
as per the ‘food chain’ hierarchy. An example of food chain of a ‘Wolf’ is given below.
Use inheritance concept where ever possible*/
