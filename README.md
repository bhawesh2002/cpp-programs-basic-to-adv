A repo containing all the programs I wrote while learning C++, _**yet again**_

(Someting very important in writing program in any language is **PSEUDO CODE**

A **‘pseudo code’** is an outline of a program,
written in a form that can easily be converted into real programming statements. Pseudo
code can neither be compiled nor executed, and there is no real formatting or syntax
rules.

Here is the ref:- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-write-a-pseudo-code/
)

:) Refrences to some topics

**_1)PercentageCalc_**

#**Precedence Of Operators** :- https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence 

#**Typecasting**  :- https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/oldtutorial/typecasting/

**2)AreaOfCircle**

#**Constant Declaration** :- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/constants-in-c-cpp/

**3)Perimeter Of Triangle**

#**nothing new here.**

_**The only thing to know in general are some basic formulas and concepts of maths**_

**5)Numerator and Denomenator**

**NOTE:-** one of the most important thing while writing code for the given question is _following the question and producing the output accordingly_.

**6)Sum Of Odds**

Nothing new here, but do note the condition supplied to **while loop**. We need to claculate the sum of cube of odd numbers upto user entered **n** terms.
In the number series half are even and half are odd, so if the user enters **n = 5** then **n*2=10** i.e 10 numbers from 1 to 10, inside the loop we add 2 to i after each cycle till **i <= n*2**, this allows us to use all odd numbers from 1 to 10 i.e 5 odd numbers(1,2,3,4,5).

**7)Absurd Factorial Series**

Nothing much here. We just need to claculate the factorial of  numbers in denominator

**8)User Operator**

A new topic  **switch case** :- https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_switch.asp
Switch Case is used to execute a block of code that the case parameter holdsIts syntax is switch(choice){
case a:
{statements}
break;
default:{statements}
}

**9)Months and Numbers**

Use of Switch case to print name of months based on user input

**10)Largest of Three**

use of comparision operators to compute the largest amongst three entered numbers
