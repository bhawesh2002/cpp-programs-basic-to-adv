A repo containing all the programs I wrote while learning C++ yet again

(Someting very important in writing program in any language is **PSEUDO CODE**

A **‘pseudo code’** is an outline of a program,
written in a form that can easily be converted into real programming statements. Pseudo
code can neither be compiled nor executed, and there is no real formatting or syntax
rules.

Here is the ref:- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-write-a-pseudo-code/
